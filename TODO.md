# TODO

1. Create:
    * ~~arbitrary precision value generation~~
    * ~~REPL interface~~
      - trim whitespace
    * logging library to log errors, etc
    * caching mechanism for memoization
    * OpenCl calculation
    * CUDA calculation
    * HIP calculation

2.  Ideas:
    * Use zlib to shink large fib values
    * Use Hex and base 64 to shink large fib values when/if stored as strings
    * Bit shifting version of Binet's formula
    * Find the length of each number, then allocate a chunk size to write to a file.

# DONE

1. Create:
    * arbitrary precision value generation
        _Used GMP library_
